## Getting started

Start by registering an Azure Data Market client ID and secret. See http://music.xbox.com/developer.

Create a client
```csharp
IXboxMusicClient client = XboxMusicClientFactory.CreateXboxMusicClient("MyClientId", "YourClientSecretYourClientSecretYourSecret=");
```

Use null to get your current geography.
Specify a 2 letter country code (such as "US" or "DE") to force a specific country.
```csharp
string country = null;
```

Search for albums in your current geography
```csharp
ContentResponse searchResponse = await client.SearchAsync(Namespace.music, "Foo Fighters", filter: SearchFilter.Albums, maxItems: 5, country: country);
Console.WriteLine("Found {0} albums. Here are the first 5:", searchResponse.Albums.TotalItemCount);
foreach (Album albumResult in searchResponse.Albums.Items)
{
    Console.WriteLine("{0}", albumResult.Name);
}
```

The console output is:
  Found 49 albums. Here are the first 5:
  Greatest Hits
  Foo Fighters
  There Is Nothing Left To Lose
  Wasting Light
  The Colour And The Shape

List tracks in the first album
```csharp
Album album = searchResponse.Albums.Items[0];
ContentResponse lookupResponse = await client.LookupAsync(album.Id, extras: ExtraDetails.Tracks, country: country);
```

Display information about the album
```csharp
album = lookupResponse.Albums.Items[0];
Console.WriteLine("Album: {0} (link: {1}, image: {2})", album.Name, album.GetLink(ContentExtensions.LinkAction.Play), album.GetImageUrl(800, 800));
foreach (Contributor contributor in album.Artists)
{
    Artist artist = contributor.Artist;
    Console.WriteLine("Artist: {0} (link: {1}, image: {2})", artist.Name, artist.GetLink(), artist.GetImageUrl(1920, 1080));
}
foreach (Track track in album.Tracks.Items)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Track: {0} - {1}", track.TrackNumber, track.Name);
}
```

The console output is:
